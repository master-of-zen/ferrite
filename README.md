* Keyboard first. No menu crawling. Press H, you got complete guide for all functions and what key does what.

* Features as options later.

# TODO

* Create ferrite-havigation for the navigation handling
* Image manager moved to ferrite-imaga
* Implement help window
* Implement name window
* Implement dimensions window
* Cache config
* Move all ui stuff to the UI crate
